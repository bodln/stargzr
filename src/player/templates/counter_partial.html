<!-- templates/counter_partial.html -->
<p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
<!-- ☝️ This is ONLY the part that changes
     Notice: No <!DOCTYPE>, no <html>, no <body>
     Just the fragment that will be inserted
     
     This matches exactly what's INSIDE the <div id="counter">
     When the server renders this template, it becomes: "<p>Count: 6</p>"
     HTMX receives this and puts it inside the div -->
